This project is for our semester in Technological Educational Institute of Central Macedonia.

## Getting Started

In Android Studio -> Checkout project from Version Control and copy the git address.

Find a story/issue in Waffle,
if none is asigned or you are asigned to the story/task create a branch named like:
```
StoryNumber-Feature
```
When commiting to the branch state what you fixed or made with the story number like:
```
Fixed that #StoryNumber
```
When commiting the last commit the message must be:
```
What you fixed. closes #StoryNumber
```

### Prerequisites

## Versioning
We use Semantic Versioning:
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.


## Deployment
